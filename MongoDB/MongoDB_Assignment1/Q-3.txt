Q-3:- How to choose between MongoDB and MySQL based on your requirements?
Ans:- Scalability, flexible schema, performance & Use cases
Advantages of MongoDB:

Schema-less: Flexible and easier to adapt to changing requirements.
Document-oriented: Natural fit for JSON data, often used in web applications.
High availability with replica sets and horizontal scaling with sharding.
Disadvantages of MongoDB:

Limited support for complex transactions compared to SQL.
May require more storage due to denormalized data.
MySQL
When to Choose MySQL:

Structured Data:

Your data model is well-defined and structured.
Schema is stable with well-understood relationships between data entities.
ACID Transactions:

Need strong consistency and complex transactions.
Applications requiring multi-row transactions, such as financial applications.
Performance:

Optimized for read-heavy applications.
Complex query requirements, including joins and aggregations.
Use Cases:

E-commerce platforms, banking systems, data warehousing.
Advantages of MySQL:

Mature and widely used: Strong community and extensive support.
ACID compliance: Ensures data integrity and consistency.
Efficient for complex queries and transactional operations.
Disadvantages of MySQL:

Less flexible schema changes.
Vertical scaling limits and potential performance bottlenecks with very large datasets.
