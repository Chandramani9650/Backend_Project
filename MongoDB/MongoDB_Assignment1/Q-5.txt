Q - 5:- What is BSON? What is the difference between BSON and JSON?
Ans:- In MongoDB, we write in JSON format only but behind the scene data is stored 
in BSON (Binary JSON) format, a binary representation of JSON. 
By utilizing BSON, MongoDB can achieve higher read and write speeds, 
reduced storage requirements, and improved data manipulation capabilities, 
making it well-suited for handling large and complex datasets while 
maintaining performance efficiency.
